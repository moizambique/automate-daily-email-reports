To automate sending daily email reports using Python, we can use the smtplib library for sending the email and schedule or cron for automating the daily task. I'll walk you through creating a script and setting up a simple email automation.
To automate sending daily email reports using Python, we can use the smtplib library for sending the email and schedule or cron for automating the daily task. I'll walk you through creating a script and setting up a simple email automation.

# Prerequisites
1. Python Environment: Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Email Account: A valid email account (e.g., Gmail) to send the emails from.
3. SMTP Server Access: Know the SMTP server details (e.g., for Gmail: smtp.gmail.com with port 587).

# Step 1: Install Required Libraries
You might need the following Python libraries:
- smtplib: For sending emails.
- email: To structure the email content.
- schedule (optional): For scheduling the daily task.

Install the schedule library if you want to use it for scheduling:

bash
pip install schedule


# Step 2: Create the Python Script
--> Python file

# Step 3: Setting Up the Script

1. Replace the Email Details: 
   - EMAIL_ADDRESS: The email address you'll be sending from.
   - EMAIL_PASSWORD: The password for your email account. For Gmail, consider using an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) for better security.
   - RECIPIENT_EMAIL: The recipient's email address.

2. Customize the Email Content: 
   - Modify the body variable in create_email_report() to include the content of your daily report.

3. Schedule the Time: 
   - In schedule_daily_email('09:00'), set the desired time (in 24-hour format) to send the email daily.

# Step 4: Running the Script

- Run the script in your terminal using:
  bash
  python daily_email_report.py
  
- The script will run indefinitely, checking every second if it's time to send the email.

# Step 5: Automating Script Execution

For automating the script execution without manual intervention, you can use:

- Windows Task Scheduler:
  - Create a task that runs the script daily.
  
- Cron Job on Unix/Linux:
  - Add the script to cron with a command like:
    bash
    0 9    /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/daily_email_report.py
    

# Step 6: Additional Improvements

- Error Handling: Improve the script by adding more robust error handling.
- Attachments: Use MIMEBase to add attachments if needed.
- Logging: Implement logging to track the script's activity.

This script will now send a daily email report automatically at the specified time.
